# Machine Learning classifier using catboost
This is a sample Machine Learning classifier using catboost model, a high-performance open source library for gradient boosting on decision trees: <br>

This model can be applied to any problem or challenge that involves estimating the probability of a sample in a dataset belonging to a particular class. It also identifies the most important features using SHAP scores. <br>
Simple encoding is applied to ordinal categories (where the order of values are important) and one-hot encoding to the rest of categories (https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/categorical-features-in-xgboost-without-manual-encoding/) <br>
